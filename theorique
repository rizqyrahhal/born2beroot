# <What is a virtual machine (VM)?>
===> A virtual machine (VM) is a virtual environment that functions as a virtual computer system with its own CPU, memory, network interface, and storage, created on a physical hardware system (located off- or on-premises). Software called a hypervisor separates the machine’s resources from the hardware and provisions them appropriately so they can be used by the VM.

# <How do VMs work?>
===> Virtualization technology allows you to share a system with many virtual environments. The hypervisor manages the hardware and separates the physical resources from the virtual environments. Resources are partitioned as needed from the physical environment to the VMs.

Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based, or "virtual" version of a computer, with dedicated amounts of CPU, memory, and storage that are "borrowed" from a physical host computer—such as your personal computer— and/or a remote server—such as a server in a cloud provider's datacenter. A virtual machine is a computer file, typically called an image, that behaves like an actual computer. It can run in a window as a separate computing environment, often to run a different operating system—or even to function as the user's entire computer experience—as is common on many people's work computers. The virtual machine is partitioned from the rest of the system, meaning that the software inside a VM can't interfere with the host computer's primary operating system

# <Why use a VM?>
===>
* Building and deploying apps to the cloud. 
* Trying out a new operating system (OS), including beta releases.
* Spinning up a new environment to make it simpler and quicker for developers to run dev-test scenarios.
* Backing up your existing OS.
* Accessing virus-infected data or running an old application by installing an older OS.
* Running software or apps on operating systems that they weren't originally intended for.
